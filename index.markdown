<h1>Hi there! üëã</h1>

<p>
  I am Saddam. With over <strong><span id="yearsOfExperience"></span></strong> years of experience specializing in API integration, particularly with technologies like MuleSoft, I have developed strong skills in software development. Along the way, I've earned industry-recognized certifications, including those in MuleSoft Development and Anypoint Platform Architecture. While MuleSoft has been central to my career, my experience extends beyond it. In my current organization, I am also an "Elevated Wings1 Certified - Full-Stack JavaScript Developer (MERN)," a program that deepened my expertise in integration patterns using JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
    Automation has been key to my success, especially in testing, whether it‚Äôs unit or integration testing. I'm familiar with various architectural patterns, including ETL, real-time, and asynchronous Pub/Sub models. If you know of any projects or teams that could benefit from my skills, please feel free to connect!
</p>
