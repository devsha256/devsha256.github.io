<h1> Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

<section>
    With over <span id="yearsOfExperience"></span> years of experience specializing in API integration, particularly with technologies like MuleSoft, I have developed strong skills in software development. Along the way, I've earned industry-recognized certifications, including those in MuleSoft Development and Anypoint Platform Architecture. While MuleSoft has been central to my career, my experience extends beyond it. In my current organization, I am also an "Elevated Wings1 Certified - Full-Stack JavaScript Developer (MERN)," a program that deepened my expertise in integration patterns using JavaScript.

    Automation has been key to my success, especially in testing, whether itâ€™s unit or integration testing. I'm familiar with various architectural patterns, including ETL, real-time, and asynchronous Pub/Sub models. If you know of any projects or teams that could benefit from my skills, please feel free to connect!
